## ðŸ”¹ What is `EmptyResult`?

`EmptyResult` is used when an action method has nothing to return. It results in a 204 No Content response.

```csharp
return new EmptyResult();
```

---

## ðŸ”¸ Basic Syntax

```csharp
public class EmptyResult : ActionResult
```

## âœ… Return Empty Result from a Controller

### Example

```csharp
public class SampleController : Controller
{
    public IActionResult DoNothing()
    {
        // Perform some logic here

        return new EmptyResult();
    }
}
```

---

## ðŸ“˜ When to Use `EmptyResult`

- When you want to return **no content** but avoid returning `null`.
- To explicitly signal that no result should be returned.
- Useful in scenarios like background logging, signal-only actions, or AJAX calls where the result doesn't matter.

---

## ðŸ”„ Alternative Approaches

### Use `NoContent()` (Preferred in APIs)

```csharp
return NoContent(); // returns 204 No Content
```

### Return `null` (not recommended)

Returning `null` can lead to unexpected results or exceptions. `EmptyResult` is safer and more explicit.

---

## ðŸ§¾ Conclusion

- `EmptyResult` is a simple way to return no content from an MVC action.
- Itâ€™s more explicit and safer than returning `null`.
- For Web APIs, prefer using `NoContent()` which also returns 204 status code.
