# 🖼️ Image Tag Helper in ASP.NET Core MVC

The Image Tag Helper (`<img>`) in ASP.NET Core MVC simplifies referencing static image files in Razor views, especially those located in the `wwwroot` folder.

---

## ✅ Syntax

```html
<img asp-src="~/images/logo.png" alt="Logo" />
```

---

## 📁 Where to Store Images

Place your image files inside the `wwwroot` directory:

```
wwwroot/
├── images/
│   └── logo.png
```

---

## 🔄 How `asp-src` Works

- `asp-src="~/images/logo.png"` resolves to `/images/logo.png`
- Automatically handles the `~` root path resolution
- Ensures paths are correct across different environments and routing contexts

---

## 🧾 Example

```html
<img asp-src="~/images/profile.png" alt="Profile Picture" class="img-thumbnail" />
```

**Renders as:**

```html
<img src="/images/profile.png" alt="Profile Picture" class="img-thumbnail">
```

---

## 🧠 Benefits

- Cleaner Razor syntax
- Avoids hardcoded relative URLs
- Easier to manage paths in large projects
- Integrates well with static file middleware

---

## ⚙️ Enable Tag Helpers

Make sure your `_ViewImports.cshtml` file includes:

```razor
@addTagHelper *, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers
```

---

## 📌 When to Use

Use the Image Tag Helper whenever you're referencing static images from Razor views and want a clean, environment-safe way to define paths.
