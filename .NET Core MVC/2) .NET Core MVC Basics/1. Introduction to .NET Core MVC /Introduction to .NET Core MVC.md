# 🌐 Introduction to .NET Core MVC

## 📘 What is .NET Core MVC?

**.NET Core MVC** is a lightweight, open-source, and cross-platform web framework developed by Microsoft. It follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** design pattern to build modern, scalable, and maintainable web applications.

- ✅ **Model**: Represents the data and business logic.
- ✅ **View**: Represents the UI.
- ✅ **Controller**: Handles user interaction, manipulates the model, and returns views.

.NET Core MVC is part of the broader ASP.NET Core platform, which also includes Razor Pages, Web APIs, Blazor, SignalR, and more.

## 🔧 Key Features

- ✨ Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- ⚡ High performance
- 🧩 Dependency injection built-in
- 🔐 Secure by default (HTTPS, Authentication & Authorization)
- 🔄 Middleware pipeline for request processing
- 📦 NuGet package-based architecture

## 🚀 Application Structure

Typical .NET Core MVC Project Layout:

```
/Controllers       → Handles user input and UI logic
/Models            → Contains business models and data access logic
/Views             → UI templates using Razor syntax
/wwwroot           → Static files (CSS, JS, images)
/Startup.cs        → Configures services and request pipeline
/Program.cs        → Entry point of the application
```

## 🧱 MVC Pattern in Action

When a request hits the application:

1. **Routing Middleware** maps the request to a Controller.
2. **Controller** processes input, interacts with Model.
3. **Model** fetches data from database or logic layer.
4. **View** renders the response and sends HTML back to the browser.

## 🔄 Request Lifecycle (Simplified)

```
Browser Request → Middleware Pipeline → Routing → Controller → Model → View → Response
```

## 🧪 Why Choose .NET Core MVC?

- Great for enterprise-grade web apps
- Clean separation of concerns with MVC
- Testability and maintainability
- Fully integrated with .NET ecosystem
- Large community and Microsoft support

## 📚 Summary

ASP.NET Core MVC is a powerful framework ideal for building dynamic web apps and APIs. With built-in dependency injection, middleware, routing, and Razor view engine, it offers a modern approach to building full-stack .NET web applications.
