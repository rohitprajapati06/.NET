# ASP.NET Core Request Processing Pipeline

## What is the Request Processing Pipeline?

The **Request Processing Pipeline** in ASP.NET Core is a sequence of **middleware components** that process HTTP requests and responses. These middleware components are executed in a specific order and are responsible for handling aspects like:

- Routing
- Authentication & Authorization
- Error Handling
- Logging
- Serving Static Files
- Generating Responses

Each middleware component:
- Receives an incoming HTTP request
- Can handle the request, pass it to the next middleware, or short-circuit the pipeline
- Can modify the outgoing HTTP response

---

## Pipeline Execution Flow

1. **Request** arrives at the ASP.NET Core web server (e.g., Kestrel)
2. Middleware components are executed in the order they are registered
3. Each component decides whether to:
   - Pass the request to the next middleware
   - Generate a response and short-circuit the pipeline
4. The **response** flows back in reverse order through the middleware components

---

## Example Pipeline Flow

```plaintext
Request -> Middleware 1 -> Middleware 2 -> Middleware 3 -> Response
                     ↑               ↑               ↑
               Post-processing   Post-processing   Post-processing
```

## Typical Middleware Order in ASP.NET Core

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();

// Developer exception page (only in development)
app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();

// Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
app.UseHttpsRedirection();

// Serve static files (e.g., CSS, JS, images)
app.UseStaticFiles();

// Routing middleware
app.UseRouting();

// Authentication
app.UseAuthentication();

// Authorization
app.UseAuthorization();

// Endpoint mapping
app.MapControllers();

app.Run();
```

---

## Middleware Registration & Execution Order

- Middleware **must** be registered in the correct order.
- Incorrect order can lead to:
  - Unauthorized access
  - Missing routes
  - Unhandled exceptions
  - Static files not served

---

## Example: Custom Middleware

```csharp
app.Use(async (context, next) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine("Before next middleware");
    await next(); // Call next middleware
    Console.WriteLine("After next middleware");
});
```

---

## Short-Circuiting the Pipeline

Middleware can choose **not to call `next()`**, which ends the pipeline early:

```csharp
app.Use(async (context, next) =>
{
    if (context.Request.Path == "/stop")
    {
        await context.Response.WriteAsync("Pipeline short-circuited.");
        return; // Stop the pipeline
    }
    await next(); // Continue pipeline
});
```

---

## Terminal Middleware

- Middleware added with `app.Run()` is **terminal**
- It does **not call** the next middleware

```csharp
app.Run(async (context) =>
{
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("Handled by terminal middleware");
});
```

---

## Summary

- The ASP.NET Core Request Processing Pipeline is built using middleware components.
- Middleware must be registered in the correct order.
- Each middleware can handle, pass, or short-circuit the request.
- Built-in and custom middleware work together to handle requests and send responses.

> Mastering middleware configuration is key to building efficient and secure ASP.NET Core web applications.
