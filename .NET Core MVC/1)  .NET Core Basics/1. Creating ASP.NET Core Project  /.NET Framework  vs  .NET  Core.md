## 🧱 Detailed Comparison

### 1. **Platform Support**

- **.NET Framework**: Runs only on Windows.
- **.NET Core**: Runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

### 2. **Application Types**

| App Type             | .NET Framework        | .NET Core / .NET |
|----------------------|------------------------|------------------|
| Web Applications     | ASP.NET Web Forms, MVC | ASP.NET Core     |
| Desktop Applications | WinForms, WPF          | WinForms, WPF (Windows only) |
| Cloud Applications   | Limited support         | Optimized support with modern tooling |
| Mobile / Cross-Platform | ❌ Not supported     | ✅ Use with Xamarin/.NET MAUI |

### 3. **Performance**

- **.NET Core** offers significantly better performance and scalability due to its lightweight, modular design and use of the latest runtime improvements.
- **.NET Framework** is more monolithic and slower in high-load scenarios.

### 4. **Deployment**

- **.NET Framework**: Installed system-wide on Windows machines.
- **.NET Core**: Can be deployed as a **self-contained** app with its own runtime or **framework-dependent** (shared runtime).

### 5. **Open Source**

- **.NET Framework**: Partially open-sourced.
- **.NET Core / .NET**: Fully open-source and developed under the [.NET Foundation](https://dotnetfoundation.org/).

### 6. **API Availability**

- **.NET Core**: Modular and supports only modern APIs through **NuGet packages**.
- **.NET Framework**: Supports legacy APIs like Web Forms, WCF, etc.
