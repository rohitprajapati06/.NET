# ASP.NET Core Middleware Components

## What are ASP.NET Core Middleware Components?

ASP.NET Core Middleware Components are the basic building blocks of the Request Processing Pipeline in ASP.NET Core Applications. The pipeline determines how HTTP Requests and Responses will be processed.

Middleware components are used to implement functionalities such as:
- Authentication
- Authorization
- Error Handling
- Routing
- Logging

Each middleware component:
- Can pass the HTTP Request to the next component in the pipeline
- Can perform tasks before and after invoking the next component

> Note: Middleware components should follow the **Single Responsibility Principle**.

## How Do We Configure Middleware Components?

Middleware is configured in the `Main()` method of the `Program.cs` file using the `WebApplication` instance.

### Example

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();

app.MapGet("/", () => "Hello World!");
app.MapGet("/greet", () => "Hello from the /greet endpoint!");
app.MapGet("/greet/{name}", (string name) => $"Hello, {name}!");
app.Run();
```

## How Does Middleware Work?

Middleware can:
- Handle HTTP requests and generate responses
- Process and modify requests before passing them on
- Process and modify responses before sending them back

### Example: Logging Middleware

- Logs request time
- Passes request to Static Files Middleware
- May short-circuit and not invoke the next middleware

## Execution Order

- **Incoming Requests**: Middleware executes **in order added**
- **Outgoing Responses**: Middleware executes **in reverse order**

Order matters to prevent unexpected behavior.

## Middleware Configuration Methods

### `MapGet`

Handles **GET** requests only.

```csharp
app.MapGet("/route", () => "response");
```

### `Map`

Handles **any HTTP method**, based on custom logic.

### `Run`

Adds **terminal middleware**; does **not call next middleware**.

```csharp
app.Run(async (context) => {
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("Response from terminal middleware");
});
```

### `Use`

Calls the next middleware in the pipeline.

```csharp
app.Use(async (context, next) => {
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("Before next middleware");
    await next();
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("After next middleware");
});
```

## Example: Using `Run` Method

```csharp
app.Run(async (context) => {
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("Getting Response from First Middleware");
});
```

## Example: Multiple Middleware with `Run`

Only the **first** one runs:

```csharp
app.Run(async (context) => {
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("Middleware 1");
});
app.Run(async (context) => {
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("Middleware 2");
});
```

## Example: `Use` to Chain Middleware

```csharp
app.Use(async (context, next) => {
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("First Middleware\n");
    await next();
});
app.Run(async (context) => {
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("Second Middleware\n");
});
```

## Terminal Middleware with `Use`

```csharp
app.Use(async (context, next) => {
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("Terminating Middleware");
    // Not calling next();
});
```

## Differences Between `Run`, `Map`, and `Use`

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Run` | Terminates the pipeline. No `next` call. |
| `Map` | Branches the pipeline based on path. |
| `Use` | Executes logic and calls `next` middleware. |

## Built-in Middleware Components

| Middleware | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `UseRouting` | Maps requests to endpoints based on route patterns. |
| `UseAuthentication` | Validates credentials and sets user identity. |
| `UseAuthorization` | Checks if user has permission to access resources. |
| `UseHttpsRedirection` | Redirects HTTP to HTTPS. |
| `UseDeveloperExceptionPage` | Shows detailed error page during development. |
| `UseExceptionHandler` | Handles exceptions in production. |
| `UseStaticFiles` | Serves static files (images, CSS, JS). |

## Summary

Middleware components are critical for managing the flow of requests and responses in ASP.NET Core applications. Understanding how to register and control their execution ensures a clean, maintainable, and secure web application.
