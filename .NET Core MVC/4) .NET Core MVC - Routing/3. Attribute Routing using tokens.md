# Attribute Routing Using Tokens in ASP.NET Core

## What is Attribute Routing?

**Attribute routing** allows you to define routes directly on controller and action methods using `[Route]`, `[HttpGet]`, `[HttpPost]`, etc.

ASP.NET Core also supports **tokens** in attribute routes to simplify route definitions and reduce duplication.

---

## Supported Tokens

ASP.NET Core provides the following tokens:

| Token      | Description                                 |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `[controller]` | Replaced with the controller name (without "Controller") |
| `[action]`     | Replaced with the action (method) name   |
| `[area]`       | Replaced with the area name (if used)    |

---

## Example: Using `[controller]` and `[action]`

```csharp
[Route("[controller]/[action]")]
public class ProductsController : Controller
{
    public IActionResult List()
    {
        return View();
    }

    public IActionResult Details(int id)
    {
        return View();
    }
}
```

### This results in:

- `/Products/List`
- `/Products/Details/5`

---

## Example: Route at Controller Level

```csharp
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class OrdersController : Controller
{
    [HttpGet("[action]")]
    public IActionResult GetAll()
    {
        return Ok();
    }

    [HttpPost("[action]")]
    public IActionResult Create()
    {
        return Ok();
    }
}
```

### This results in:

- `GET /api/Orders/GetAll`
- `POST /api/Orders/Create`

---

## Using `[area]` Token (if Areas are defined)

```csharp
[Area("Admin")]
[Route("[area]/[controller]/[action]")]
public class DashboardController : Controller
{
    public IActionResult Index()
    {
        return View();
    }
}
```

### This results in:

- `/Admin/Dashboard/Index`

---

## Benefits of Using Tokens

- Avoids hardcoding route names
- Makes route maintenance easier
- Ensures routes automatically reflect class or method name changes

---

## Summary

- Attribute routing with tokens helps reduce route repetition and improve maintainability.
- Tokens like `[controller]`, `[action]`, and `[area]` are replaced at runtime.
- Especially useful for large applications and consistent API route patterns.

> Use attribute routing tokens to simplify and standardize routing in your ASP.NET Core MVC apps.
