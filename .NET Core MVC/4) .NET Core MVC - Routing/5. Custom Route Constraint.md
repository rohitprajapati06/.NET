# Custom Route Constraint in ASP.NET Core MVC

## What is a Route Constraint?

A **route constraint** in ASP.NET Core is used to restrict the value of a route parameter. This ensures that only certain values are matched by the route. Constraints are applied in the route templates and can be built-in or custom.

---

## Built-in Constraints Example

```csharp
[Route("student/{id:int}")]
public IActionResult Details(int id)
{
    // Only matches if 'id' is an integer
    ...
}
```

---

## When to Use Custom Route Constraints?

Use a **custom route constraint** when:
- The built-in constraints donâ€™t meet your needs
- You want to validate route parameters using custom logic
- You need reusable logic across multiple routes

---

## Step-by-Step: Creating a Custom Route Constraint

---

### Step 1: Create a Custom Constraint Class

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing;
using System;

public class EvenNumberConstraint : IRouteConstraint
{
    public bool Match(HttpContext httpContext, IRouter route, string routeKey,
                      RouteValueDictionary values, RouteDirection routeDirection)
    {
        if (values.TryGetValue(routeKey, out var value) && value != null)
        {
            if (int.TryParse(value.ToString(), out int number))
            {
                return number % 2 == 0; // Only even numbers allowed
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

---

### Step 2: Register the Constraint

#### In `Startup.cs` (ASP.NET Core 3.1 or earlier)

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddRouting(options =>
    {
        options.ConstraintMap.Add("even", typeof(EvenNumberConstraint));
    });

    services.AddControllersWithViews();
}
```

#### In `Program.cs` (ASP.NET Core 6+)

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddRouting(options =>
{
    options.ConstraintMap.Add("even", typeof(EvenNumberConstraint));
});

builder.Services.AddControllersWithViews();
```

---

### Step 3: Use the Constraint in a Route

```csharp
[Route("student/{id:even}")]
public IActionResult GetEvenStudent(int id)
{
    return Content($"Student ID is even: {id}");
}
```

> This route will only match if the `id` is an even number.

---

## Summary

- Route constraints control which URL patterns a route will match.
- Custom constraints allow for advanced matching logic.
- Register your custom constraint with a name using `ConstraintMap`.
- Use the custom constraint name in your route template.

---

## Use Cases for Custom Constraints

- Allow only GUIDs, phone numbers, or specific formats
- Role-based or permission-based routing
- Validating dates, ranges, or domain-specific logic

> Custom route constraints add flexibility and control to your routing logic in ASP.NET Core MVC.
