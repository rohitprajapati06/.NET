# 🧭 Custom Routing in ASP.NET Core MVC

In this article, we will explore **Custom Routing** in ASP.NET Core MVC with examples and how it differs from conventional routing. Custom routing gives more control over the URL structure and can be used to improve SEO and readability.

## 🚀 What is Routing?

Routing is the process of mapping a URL to a controller action. In ASP.NET Core MVC, routing is handled by **middleware**, which matches incoming request URLs to defined route templates.

There are two primary types of routing in ASP.NET Core MVC:

1. **Conventional Routing** – Uses patterns like `{controller}/{action}/{id?}`
2. **Attribute Routing (Custom Routing)** – Uses attributes directly on controller actions

## 🔧 Setting Up Custom Routing

To use custom routes in ASP.NET Core MVC, you can define them using the `[Route]` and `[Http*]` attributes.

### Example: Controller with Attribute Routing

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

namespace MyApp.Controllers
{
    [Route("students")]
    public class StudentController : Controller
    {
        [Route("")]
        public IActionResult Index()
        {
            return View();
        }

        [Route("details/{id:int}")]
        public IActionResult Details(int id)
        {
            // logic to fetch student by ID
            return View();
        }
    }
}
```

This defines the following routes:

- `/students` → `StudentController.Index()`
- `/students/details/5` → `StudentController.Details(5)`

---

## ✏️ Using Route Constraints

You can constrain parameters using inline constraints:

```csharp
[Route("students/details/{id:int:min(1)}")]
```

This ensures the `id` is an integer with a minimum value of 1.

### Common Route Constraints:

| Constraint | Description              |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| `int`     | Must be an integer       |
| `bool`    | Must be a Boolean value  |
| `datetime`| Must be a date           |
| `guid`    | Must be a GUID           |
| `min(x)`  | Minimum value constraint |
| `max(x)`  | Maximum value constraint |

## 🛠️ Route Names and Custom URLs

You can name routes using `Name`:

```csharp
[Route("profile/{username}", Name = "UserProfile")]
public IActionResult Profile(string username)
{
    return View();
}
```

Generate URL using route name:

```csharp
var url = Url.RouteUrl("UserProfile", new { username = "john" });
```

---

## 🧪 Combining Attribute and Conventional Routing

You can still use conventional routing in `Program.cs`:

```csharp
app.MapControllerRoute(
    name: "default",
    pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
```

And override it selectively using attribute routing.

## ✅ Advantages of Custom Routing

- Better control over URL structure
- Improved SEO with clean, readable URLs
- Easier to handle RESTful APIs

## 🧹 Summary

| Routing Type     | Where Defined                  | Flexibility | Example                            |
|------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|------------------------------------|
| Conventional     | `Program.cs` or `Startup.cs`   | Medium      | `{controller}/{action}/{id?}`      |
| Attribute (Custom) | In controller using attributes | High        | `[Route("students/details/{id}")]` |

Choose the routing strategy that fits your project structure and design goals.
