# _ViewImports.cshtml in ASP.NET Core MVC

## What is `_ViewImports.cshtml`?

`_ViewImports.cshtml` is a special Razor file in ASP.NET Core MVC used to include common namespaces, tag helpers, and other Razor directives across multiple views. It helps keep views clean and avoids repetitive using/import statements.

---

## Common Uses

### 1. **Import Namespaces**

```csharp
@using MyApp.Models
@using System.Linq
```

These namespaces become available to all Razor views within the folder hierarchy.

---

### 2. **Add Tag Helpers**

```csharp
@addTagHelper *, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers
```

This line enables the use of built-in or custom tag helpers like `<form>`, `<input asp-for="...">`, etc.

You can also import custom tag helpers:

```csharp
@addTagHelper *, MyApp.CustomTagHelpers
```

---

### 3. **Set View Engine Options**

```csharp
@inherits Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Razor.RazorPage<TModel>
```

This is used to customize the base class for views. Typically not required unless you're building a custom view engine behavior.

---

### 4. **Remove Tag Helpers**

If you want to disable a tag helper:

```csharp
@removeTagHelper *, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers
```

---

## File Location and Scope

- Typically placed inside the `/Views` folder.
- Applies to all Razor views in the same folder and subfolders.
- You can override it by placing another `_ViewImports.cshtml` in a subfolder.

---

## Example File Structure

```
Views/
├── _ViewImports.cshtml         → applies to all views
├── _ViewStart.cshtml
├── Home/
│   └── Index.cshtml
├── Products/
│   ├── _ViewImports.cshtml     → overrides/extends global imports
│   └── List.cshtml
```

---

## Sample `_ViewImports.cshtml`

```csharp
@using MyApp.Models
@using MyApp.ViewModels
@addTagHelper *, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers
```

---

## Summary

- `_ViewImports.cshtml` centralizes Razor directives like `@using`, `@addTagHelper`, and `@inherits`.
- Helps keep views clean and maintainable.
- Can be scoped globally or per-folder.
- Essential for enabling Tag Helpers and importing shared namespaces.

> Use `_ViewImports.cshtml` to simplify Razor view development and maintain consistency across your ASP.NET Core MVC project.
