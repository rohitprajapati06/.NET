# Different Ways to Render Partial Views in ASP.NET Core MVC

Partial Views in ASP.NET Core MVC allow you to render reusable view logic or UI components like headers, footers, or widgets. There are **multiple ways to render partial views**, depending on your needs ‚Äî synchronous or asynchronous rendering, with or without models.

---

## ‚úÖ 1. `Html.Partial`

- **Usage**: Synchronously renders the partial view and returns the result as an HTML string.
- **When to use**: When you don‚Äôt need to pass a model or when you‚Äôre rendering static content.

```cshtml
@Html.Partial("_MyPartialView")
```

### With Model:
```cshtml
@Html.Partial("_MyPartialView", myModel)
```

---

## ‚úÖ 2. `Html.RenderPartial`

- **Usage**: Renders the partial view directly to the response output stream. This is more efficient than `Html.Partial`.
- **When to use**: When you want better performance and don't need to manipulate the result.

```cshtml
@{ Html.RenderPartial("_MyPartialView"); }
```

### With Model:
```cshtml
@{ Html.RenderPartial("_MyPartialView", myModel); }
```

---

## ‚úÖ 3. `Html.PartialAsync`

- **Usage**: Asynchronously renders the partial view and returns it as a string.
- **When to use**: In async Razor pages or views.

```cshtml
@await Html.PartialAsync("_MyPartialView")
```

### With Model:
```cshtml
@await Html.PartialAsync("_MyPartialView", myModel)
```

---

## ‚úÖ 4. `Html.RenderPartialAsync`

- **Usage**: Asynchronously renders the partial view directly to the output stream.
- **When to use**: For high-performance scenarios in asynchronous views.

```cshtml
@await Html.RenderPartialAsync("_MyPartialView")
```

### With Model:
```cshtml
@await Html.RenderPartialAsync("_MyPartialView", myModel)
```

---

## ‚úÖ 5. `ViewComponent` (Advanced Alternative)

- Though not a partial view in the strictest sense, **ViewComponents** provide more complex reusable rendering logic with their own controller-style behavior.

Example:
```cshtml
@await Component.InvokeAsync("MyComponent", new { id = 1 })
```

## üîÑ Comparison Table

| Method                | Synchronous | Asynchronous | Returns HTML | Writes to Response | Model Support |
|-----------------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|--------------------|----------------|
| `Html.Partial`        | ‚úÖ          | ‚ùå           | ‚úÖ           | ‚ùå                 | ‚úÖ             |
| `Html.RenderPartial`  | ‚úÖ          | ‚ùå           | ‚ùå           | ‚úÖ                 | ‚úÖ             |
| `Html.PartialAsync`   | ‚ùå          | ‚úÖ           | ‚úÖ           | ‚ùå                 | ‚úÖ             |
| `Html.RenderPartialAsync` | ‚ùå      | ‚úÖ           | ‚ùå           | ‚úÖ                 | ‚úÖ             |

## üìå Best Practices

- Use `RenderPartialAsync` in large applications or where performance is critical.
- Use `PartialAsync` when returning HTML string is necessary.
- Avoid using `Html.Partial` or `RenderPartial` in Razor Pages (favor async).
- Use **ViewComponents** if the partial logic is complex or controller-like.

## üß™ Example Partial View

```cshtml
<!-- Views/Shared/_MyPartialView.cshtml -->
<div>
    <p>Hello, @Model.Name!</p>
</div>
```

Usage in main view:
```cshtml
@Html.Partial("_MyPartialView", new { Name = "John" })
```

## Conclusion

Partial views help break down large views into manageable, reusable pieces. Choosing the right rendering method depends on your performance requirements and complexity.
