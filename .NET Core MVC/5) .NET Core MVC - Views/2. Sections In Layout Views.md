# 📚 Sections in Layout Views - ASP.NET Core MVC

## 🧩 What are Sections?

**Sections** allow you to define optional placeholders in a layout where **child views can inject content**.

They are useful when you want to allow specific views to add scripts, styles, or any content **only when needed**.

---

## 🛠️ How to Define a Section in Layout View

In your `_Layout.cshtml` file, you define a section using:

```csharp
@RenderSection("SectionName", required: false)
```

- `"SectionName"`: the name of the section.
- `required`: if `true`, any view using this layout must define this section.

### 🔍 Example

```html
<body>
    <main role="main" class="container">
        @RenderBody()
    </main>

    @RenderSection("Scripts", required: false)
</body>
```

## 🧾 How to Use a Section in a View

In a view (like `Index.cshtml`), you define the section like this:

```csharp
@section Scripts {
    <script src="~/js/home.js"></script>
}
```

> ✅ Must be placed outside `@{ ... }` blocks.  
> ❌ Cannot be used in partial views directly.

## 🧪 Full Example

### 🔧 _Layout.cshtml

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>@ViewData["Title"]</title>
</head>
<body>
    @RenderBody()

    @RenderSection("Scripts", required: false)
</body>
</html>
```

### 🖥️ Index.cshtml

```csharp
@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Home";
}

<h2>Welcome!</h2>

@section Scripts {
    <script>alert('Hello from Home');</script>
}
```

---

## ❌ What if the Section is Required but Missing?

If `@RenderSection("Scripts", required: true)` is used in layout, and the view doesn't define that section, you’ll get a runtime error:

```
The following sections have been defined but have not been rendered: 'Scripts'.
```

## 🎯 When to Use Sections

| Use Case                      | Why Use a Section?                       |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Page-specific JavaScript     | Avoid loading all scripts site-wide      |
| Modal or client-side logic   | Inject only in views that need it        |
| Additional styles or headers | Customize layout elements per page       |

---

## 📌 Best Practices

- Keep section names meaningful (e.g., `"Scripts"`, `"Modals"`).
- Avoid unnecessary `required: true` unless absolutely necessary.
- Use `@section` only in **views**, not in **partial views**.

## 🧠 Summary

| Feature                | Description                                  |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `@RenderSection`       | Defines a section in layout                  |
| `@section`             | Used in views to inject content into layout  |
| `required: true/false` | Determines if section must be defined        |
| Location               | Layout in `/Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml`     |

Sections offer a flexible way to **customize layouts per view**, without rewriting the layout structure.
