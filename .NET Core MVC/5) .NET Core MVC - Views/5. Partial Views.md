# 🧩 Partial Views in ASP.NET Core MVC

## ✅ What is a Partial View?

A **Partial View** is a reusable component in ASP.NET Core MVC that renders a portion of HTML markup. It helps in reducing code duplication by isolating shared HTML segments into separate files.

---

## 📌 When to Use Partial Views?

- Display common UI sections like headers, footers, navigation menus, or sidebars.
- Break down complex views into smaller components.
- Update portions of the page using AJAX.

---

## 📁 Creating a Partial View

Create a `.cshtml` file (e.g., `_StudentCard.cshtml`) in the `Views/Shared/` or relevant `Views/ControllerName/` folder.

```html
<!-- Views/Shared/_StudentCard.cshtml -->
@model FirstCoreMVCWebApplication.Models.Student

<div class="student-card">
    <h3>@Model.Name</h3>
    <p>Branch: @Model.Branch</p>
    <p>Section: @Model.Section</p>
    <p>Gender: @Model.Gender</p>
</div>
```

## 🔄 Rendering Partial Views

### 1. Using `Html.Partial`

```csharp
@Html.Partial("_StudentCard", student)
```

### 2. Using `Html.RenderPartial`

```csharp
@{ Html.RenderPartial("_StudentCard", student); }
```

### 3. Using `Html.PartialAsync`

```csharp
@await Html.PartialAsync("_StudentCard", student)
```

---

## 🧠 Strongly Typed Partial Views

```html
@model FirstCoreMVCWebApplication.Models.Student
```

Then pass the model like this:

```csharp
@Html.Partial("_StudentCard", student)
```

---

## 📥 Passing Data to Partial Views

```csharp
@foreach (var student in Model.StudentList)
{
    @Html.Partial("_StudentCard", student)
}
```

---

## 🧪 Example Scenario

### Controller:

```csharp
public IActionResult Index()
{
    var students = _repository.GetAllStudent();
    return View(students);
}
```

### View:

```html
@model List<Student>

@foreach (var student in Model)
{
    @Html.Partial("_StudentCard", student)
}
```

## 📍 Partial View vs Layout View

| Feature           | Partial View | Layout View   |
|------------------|--------------|---------------|
| Purpose          | Reusable sections of HTML | Common layout structure |
| Rendering        | With `Html.Partial()` or `RenderPartial()` | With `@RenderBody()` or `@RenderSection()` |
| Contains `@RenderBody()`? | ❌ | ✅ |
| Used For         | Components like a list, card, form | Page skeleton like header, footer, etc. |

## 🏁 Conclusion

Partial Views in ASP.NET Core MVC:

- Promote reusability.
- Reduce duplication.
- Make large views more manageable.
- Support AJAX and asynchronous rendering.
