# ASP.NET Core View Components

View Components are reusable parts of a Razor view that combine rendering logic and markup. They help keep views clean and encapsulate functionality.

---

## ✅ When to Use View Components?

- When the content includes logic (e.g., database access)
- To avoid repeating code across multiple views
- For building widgets like menus, shopping carts, footers, etc.

---

## 🧱 Structure of a View Component

A View Component consists of:

1. A **C# class** (inheriting from `ViewComponent`)
2. A **View** (`.cshtml` file)

---

## 📦 Creating a View Component

### 1. Create the Component Class

```csharp
public class LatestProductsViewComponent : ViewComponent
{
    private readonly IProductService _productService;

    public LatestProductsViewComponent(IProductService productService)
    {
        _productService = productService;
    }

    public async Task<IViewComponentResult> InvokeAsync()
    {
        var products = await _productService.GetLatestAsync();
        return View(products);
    }
}
```

- Name must end with `ViewComponent`
- Method must return `IViewComponentResult`

---

### 2. Create the View

Create view at:

```
Views/Shared/Components/LatestProducts/Default.cshtml
```

```razor
@model IEnumerable<Product>

<div class="latest-products">
    @foreach (var item in Model)
    {
        <div>@item.Name - ₹@item.Price</div>
    }
</div>
```

---

## 💡 Using a View Component in Razor View

```razor
@await Component.InvokeAsync("LatestProducts")
```

With parameters:

```razor
@await Component.InvokeAsync("Cart", new { userId = 101 })
```

---

## 📁 Folder Structure Example

```
/Views
  /Shared
    /Components
      /LatestProducts
        Default.cshtml
```

---

## 🧪 Synchronous Version (optional)

```csharp
public IViewComponentResult Invoke()
{
    var data = _service.GetData();
    return View(data);
}
```

---

## 🔧 Testing View Components

You can unit test View Components by:

- Instantiating the component with mocks
- Calling `InvokeAsync()` or `Invoke()`
- Verifying the returned view and model
