# _ViewStart.cshtml in ASP.NET Core MVC

## What is `_ViewStart.cshtml`?

`_ViewStart.cshtml` is a special Razor file in ASP.NET Core MVC that is used to configure common settings for Razor views. It helps reduce repetitive code by setting properties that apply to multiple views.

---

## Purpose

The most common use of `_ViewStart.cshtml` is to set the **layout** for views.

```csharp
@{
    Layout = "_Layout";
}
```

This means every view that is rendered will use `_Layout.cshtml` as its layout unless overridden explicitly.

---

## Location and Scope

- Typically located in the **`Views`** folder or a specific **area or folder**.
- Settings apply to all views in that folder **and subfolders**.

You can have multiple `_ViewStart.cshtml` files:
- A global one at `/Views/_ViewStart.cshtml`
- Local ones inside subfolders (e.g., `/Views/Products/_ViewStart.cshtml`) to override settings for a specific section.

---

## How it Works

When a view is rendered, ASP.NET Core:
1. Looks for `_ViewStart.cshtml` in the current folder.
2. Walks up the folder hierarchy and merges any parent `_ViewStart.cshtml` settings.
3. Executes the logic in those files **before** executing the main view.

---

## Overriding Layout

If a view needs a different layout or no layout at all:

```csharp
@{
    Layout = null; // No layout
}
```

or

```csharp
@{
    Layout = "_AdminLayout"; // Use different layout
}
```

## Example File Structure

```
Views/
├── _ViewStart.cshtml          → applies to all views
├── Home/
│   └── Index.cshtml
├── Products/
│   ├── _ViewStart.cshtml      → overrides layout for products
│   └── List.cshtml
```

---

## Summary

- `_ViewStart.cshtml` sets shared Razor view configurations like `Layout`.
- Reduces duplication across Razor views.
- Can be scoped globally or per-folder.
- Useful for consistent and maintainable layout management.

> Use `_ViewStart.cshtml` to define common settings and make Razor views cleaner and more DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
